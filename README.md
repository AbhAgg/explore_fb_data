# Facebook Data in Time and Space project for Ethi


This repository has been forked from the main team repository and my contribution has been listed below:
*	Facebook time series data for temporal tracking of peopleâ€™s activity since they first signed-up for interactive visualisation.
*	Quantification of data included when the user liked any pages, posts, comments etc. or posted any information on their account. 
*	Designing ETL pipeline to extract data from JSON file, removing incorrect data to prepare a clean dataset and further obtain useful info. 
*	Analysing online data using various libraries in python such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.


Simple visualization of User Facebook Data using D3.js:
  - Rotating globe and heatmap displaying user's "your places" and daily facebook activity
  
Data displayed : 

    - User's : Facebook "places"
    
    - Daily interactions on Facebook ( eg: posts, comments, messages )
    
Visualisation Code and Data Preprocessing code in their respective folder.

# Usage

Html will display the visualiation. 

For customisation of user data and custom display :
  - Download user Facebook data from Facebook Profile. Optionally, you can use the sample dataset provided at explore_fb_data/supporting_files/facebook-sampledataset.zip
  - Run Jupiter Notebook file to clean and format folder for use. This will generate    updated json files.
  - Replace "your_place.json" with your own in the visualisation folder ( if renamed, make sure to correct the path in the code )
  - To display other data on the globe such as "used_ip_addresses.json"/"where_you've_logged_in.json" , uncomment corresponding functions and replace file with your own. You will need to comment out the working "your_places" function.
  
  -Dropdown lists for data files and heatmap years available for optional usage:
  - uncomment, create a div containing the <select id="" ></select> and place in body
  
 # Colours
  - Colours customisables in css section.
  - For HeatMap Customization refer to @SeBassTian23 repository (https://github.com/SeBassTian23/CalendarHeatmap)
